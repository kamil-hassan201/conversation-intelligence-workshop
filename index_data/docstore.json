The block header containsthe hash value4of the previous\nblock,5the timestamp6and other\ninformation, the nonce7and the\nMerkle Tree Hash value, which\nb a s e do na l lt r a n s a c t i o n sa n d\ninformation recorded in the cur-rent block. The hash value of the\nprevious block contained in the\ncurrent block is calculated by thehash function. Blockchain uses\nsequential blocks to record infor-\nmation and connects each otherwith hash values. Once there\nexists manipulation in the previ-\nous block, all hash values in thefollow-up blocks will change.\nEach node\n8tries to \ufb01nd a\nnonce that can make the \ufb01rst\nfew digits of the current block \u2019s\nhash value to be zero by trial\nand error. In the blockchain, ifyou change the data in one\nblock, the hash values for that\nblock and all subsequent blockswill change (see formula (1)).\nFor example, node A has tam-\npered with the data recorded onthei\nthblock, and the hash value\nof the ithblock changes immedi-\nately. This in turn causes allsubsequent blocks \u2019(i.e., block\ni+ 1 and the following blocks)\nhash values to change.\nHash value of Block\ni\n=HInformation contained\u00f0\nin block header of Block i\u00de\n=HHash value of Block i\u22121, \u00f0\ntimestamp and otherinformation,Nonce,\nMerkle Tree Hash value \u00de\n\u00f01\u00de\nThe blockchain is a distrib-\nuted ledger, which consists of a\nseries of nodes, that is, copies ofthe ledgers. Nodes are com-\nputers connected to the block-\nchain network, who areresponsible for validating and\nrelaying information in the\nblockchain. Each node in theblockchain network has a copy\nof the ledger. If information of\none node in the blockchain hasbeen tampered with, the \ufb01nal\nhash value of this node will be\ndifferent from those whoseinformation has not been tam-\npered with. This mechanism\nensures the traceability that thetampering will be quickly dis-\ncovered. Through distributed\nledger technology and hashchaining, the blockchain\nensures information to be\ntransparent, secure, andimmutable.\nThe existing blockchain\ntechnology mainly uses the\nproof-of-work (PoW) mecha-\nnism\n9to help mining10new\nblocks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46785028-5c7c-4304-90a9-007e03ed595b": {"__data__": {"id_": "46785028-5c7c-4304-90a9-007e03ed595b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "691ae5e6-1011-4fa5-aa18-c2dab80b1005", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "cfbbfbf2c3ebec8d69a8c22e7f18175afece75136c1b1b65e8a2e670df95a7fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "f51328c1-51a2-4b3a-8e07-9bdd08319987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "524fab4e859f59d1b89899937af02203c9ef78569c2781c3466d613b888a1cd3"}}, "hash": "34df659897f946b85e64b378fbedeaf1ac6422c0777643ea6c56d3530423fa43", "text": "PoW assigns the right\nto construct new blocks and\ncertain rewards to the earliest\nuser who has calculated the\nnonce.

The total marketcapitalization of bitcoin is as\nhigh as $237.9 billion. Cur-\nrently, there are about 11,800bitcoin nodes globally, of\nwhich about 27% are in the\nUnited States.\n15\nBitcoin is a decentralized\ncryptocurrency without govern-\nment control, which makes itdif\ufb01cult to become the legal\ntender.

Mod-ern accounting originated from\nthe commercial transactions in\nthe 13th century Italy. In orderto improve the accuracy of\naccounting records, merchants\ninvented the double-entrybookkeeping method, which\nwas widely adopted after Luca\nPacioli summarized it in hismathematics textbook pub-\nlished in Venice in 1494\n(Waymire & Basu, 2008).\nThe continuous expansion\nof\ufb01rms\u2019activities has gradu-\nally led to a demand for exter-nal\ufb01nancing, and \ufb01rms have\nincentives to obtain the trust of\ncapital providers to reduce thecost of capital. Meanwhile,\ncapital providers including\ninvestors and lenders also\ndemand information to keep\ntrack of the \ufb01nancial positions\nand operating performance of\nthe\ufb01rm in order to ensure the\nsafety of their capital. In orderto gain the trust of capital pro-\nviders, \ufb01rms have incentives to\nprovide \ufb01nancial informationto existing and potential capi-\ntal providers.\n16In theory,\ninsiders have more internalinformation about business\noperations than outsiders. The\nexistence of information asym-metry provides opportunities\nfor\ufb01rms to manipulate\nreports. To obtain more capi-tal or out of personal interests\nof insiders, insiders have\nincentives to mislead outsidecapital providers about the\n\ufb01nancial positions and operat-\ning performance of theentity (Watts, 1977; Watts &\nZimmerman, 1983).\nIn order to assure the\nintegrity of \ufb01nancial statements\nand disclosure, the independent\nexternal auditing systememerged (Watts & Zimmerman,\n1983). Through the implemen-\ntation of auditing procedures,auditors could discover fraud\nand errors in \ufb01nancial state-\nments and accordingly reducethe opportunistic behaviors of\ninsiders to some extent. There-\nfore, the external auditing sys-tem could to a certain extent\nreduce information asymmetry\nbetween \ufb01rms\u2019insiders and the\noutside information users and\nincrease the value of the \ufb01rm\n(Jensen & Meckling, 1976;Watts & Zimmerman, 1983).\nHowever, the Enron and\nWorldCom accounting scandalshave shown that the external\nauditors did not properly main-\ntain independent, or cannotfully discover fraud and errors\nin\ufb01rms\u2019\ufb01nancial statements.\nIts supervision and restraint on\ufb01rms\u2019insiders are not strictly\neffective. Except for auditors\nfailing to reduce the detectionrisk well, the inherent and con-\ntrol risks of the audited \ufb01rm are\nalso important factors of auditrisks.\n17In other words, audit-\ning, as a third-party monitoring\nmechanism, can only reduce butnot eliminate fraud and errors\nin\ufb01rms\u2019disclosure.\nIn summary, the emergence\nand development of \ufb01nancial\naccounting and independent\nauditing is to solve the problemof information asymmetry\nbetween \ufb01rms and external\ninformation users. However,due to con \ufb02icting interests\nbetween insiders and outsiders,\nthe opaqueness of accountingand auditing, and nonindepen-\ndence of the auditing, \ufb01nancial\naccounting and external audit-ing cannot completely solve the\nproblem of information asym-\nmetry between insiders andexternal information users.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53140883-6a1f-4dda-b5eb-d24120b3d9b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "53140883-6a1f-4dda-b5eb-d24120b3d9b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "34c59216-fadd-49d9-b75f-729c51f99575", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "fc38a398a0f1124cf8cb58eac19da283639288ae65a62ec64f3959a0792772fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "3980a99a-6ab0-4b75-873a-4538555290d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "96314caab2193775c464eabc30cb5d19c0f0cd0d2b6a83da0c9ebf3e3070205c"}}, "hash": "7301e0f58a9f1d5a2fefb262637eb553ae67300f9e77b8add20bb23a5b31e495", "text": "Tentative Plan for the\nApplication of Blockchain in\nFinancial Accounting18\nListed companies need to\ndisclose \ufb01nancial statements\nincluding balance sheet, incomestatement, statement of cash\n\ufb02ow, statement of changes in\nequity, and notes to the marketon a regular basis under the\ncurrent regulatory system.

Listed companies\nonly provide regular \ufb01\nnancial\nstatements to the market, butdo not publicize the accounting\nprocedures for the preparation\nof reports. Although this insti-\ntutional arrangement could\nprotect the proprietary infor-mation of \ufb01rms, there are a\nseries of negative consequences\nas well.

In the short\nrun, the blockchain technology\ncould be used as a platform for\ufb01rms to voluntarily disclose\ninformation, which is a high-\nquality signaling that enables\ufb01rms to solve the trust problem\nwith investors.

The focus of indepen-dent auditing will shift frompreventing counterfeiting inaccounting to analyzing the\nreasonability and authenticity\nof business operations. More-over, the duty of \ufb01nancial\naccountants will change fromrecording transactions and pre-paring \ufb01nancial statements to\nensuring the authenticity ofsource documents and the rea-sonability of smart contractsused in accounting blockchain.Other threats including theinformation con \ufb01dentiality of\n\ufb01rms and increasing dif \ufb01culty\nof regulation can cause hin-\ndrance to the application.

Smart contract is a program that\nautomates some transactions or\nprocedures. Under certain condi-tions, smart contract codes can be\nautomatically executed by block-\nchain networks without the\ninvolvement of third parties.\n3. This section introduces principles\nof the blockchain technology,\nmore details can be found in Nar-\nayanan et al. (2016) and Antono-poulos (2017).\n4. A hash value is a \ufb01xed-length col-\nlection of numbers and letters that\ngenerated by cryptographic func-\ntions for all information containedin a block header. Since the infor-\nmation contained in each block is\nessentially unique, the hash value\nof each block is also unique.\n5. The \ufb01rst block in the blockchain is\nthe genesis block, which does not\ncontain the hash value of the pre-\nvious block.\n6. Each block has a timestamp and it\nis part of the block \u2019s information.\n7. The nonce must be able to make\nthe\ufb01rst few digits of the block \u2019s\nhash value to be zero.

Nodes are computers connected to\nthe blockchain network, which are\nthe basis of block mining andcon\ufb01rmation.\n9. Proof of work (PoW) is one of the\nmost commonly used consensus\nmechanisms for mining. The\nadvantage of PoW is that it canensure the reliability and immuta-bility of information. The disad-vantage is that it largely consumeselectricity. Another important con-sensus mechanism is the Proof ofstake (PoS), which uses nodes \u2019\nshare of the stake as a basis formining. Compared with the PoW,the PoS does not require eachnode to compete for calculatingthe nonce, which can save energy.\nHowever, the disadvantage is that\nit is dif \ufb01cult to ensure the reliabil-\nity and immutability ofinformation.\n10. Mining is the process of adding\ntransaction records to the publicledger.\n11. In the bitcoin blockchain, the\nbonus for the new bitcoin block isbitcoin. Under the bitcoin proto-col, bitcoin blockchain will notgenerate new bitcoins after the\nyear of 2140. The party who sub-\nmits new transactions must attachbilling fees to the node who willrecord the transaction.\n12. The nodes in the blockchain can\nincrease their odds to get the\nright nonce by increasing thecomputing capacity. However,given large numbers of nodes, itis impossible for a single node toobtain the mining right allthe time.\n13. Assuming that the total number of\nnodes is N, the number of nodes\nwho records false information isK: as long as the nodes who\nrecorded authentic information\n(N-K) is more than the number of\nnodes (K) where the false informa-\ntion is recorded, the probability\nthat the faithful nodes (N-K)\nobtains subsequent mining rightwill be greater than the nodes\nrecording the false information,\naccordingly, the probability of the\nblock with authentic informationbeing accepted by the entire net-\nwork is larger. This process\nensures the ledger copy thatrecorded authentic informationwill be copied by other nodes inthe blockchain while the block-chain node containing false infor-mation will not be accepted byother nodes because their chain is\nshorter. Those nodes with false\ninformation also lose the opportu-nity to construct subsequent newblocks and the correspondingrewards. Therefore, unless oneparty controls more than 50% ofthe total number of nodes, theblockchain technology can ensure\nthe authenticity and tamper-proof\nof the information on the block-chain (Antonopoulos, 2017; Nar-ayanan et al., 2016).\n14. A permissioned blockchain\nrestricts recording rights to a select\ngroup of authorized users who\nnegotiate governance and control\nrights among themselves, in a pro-cess loosely resembling a partner-\nship agreement (Yermack, 2017).\n15. The data of nodes \u2019number comes\nfrom https://bitnodes.21.co/, and\nother data comes from https://blockchain.info/stats.\n16. In 1929, the Great Depression\noccurred in the United States.Many people think that account-\ning fraud and insuf \ufb01cient informa-\ntion disclosure are important\nreasons for the crisis. Therefore, in\nthe early 1930s, the United Statesestablished the Securities and\nExchange Commission (SEC) and\nrequired listed companies to pro-\nvide \ufb01nancial information regu-\nlarly to the market to protect theinterests of investors (King, 2006,\npp. 55 \u201363).\n17. The audit risk depends on the risk\nof material misstatement and the\nrisk of detection. The risk of mate-rial misstatement depends on the\ninherent risk and the control risk.\nInherent risk refers to the risk ofmisstatement that occurs when\nthere is no internal control. Con-\ntrol risk refers to the possibility\nthat internal control fails to pre-\nvent, detect and correct the mate-rial misstatement that has\noccurred in time.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95f49774-d0c9-49b4-bfec-f3a8a03b5b9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "95f49774-d0c9-49b4-bfec-f3a8a03b5b9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "166a9c4a-153e-4539-b842-70eefe7909e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "ebe183c9e5c8c83519152c73680cb0d1aab2b14fded89dc87a5aff278f3a98d5"}, "2": {"node_id": "e50126fe-dced-44cb-9eb4-248e3cbb93b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Fardapaper-Blockchain-The-Introduction-and-Its-Application-in-Financial-Accounting.pdf"}, "hash": "297c9469ab68bd7d450389aa2f4bc235bb54a2a469c47cf1ba12d8d853b0cfae"}}, "hash": "fb91215203e1f35b52f0320b145f15de19b71075fde9f533cb9f0bae04088c22", "text": "If the inherent\nrisk and control risk of \ufb01nancialreporting is too high, the auditors\nmust reduce the detection risk to avery low level to reduce the audit\nrisk to an acceptable level.\n18.

In theory, the blockchain \u2019s trans-\nparency and permanence character-istics have increased the probability\nand cost of false disclosures. There-\nfore, \ufb01rms tend to disclose real and\nreliable information on the block-\nchain, and in turn, investors willrequire a lower rate of return on\nequity since they have the high-\nquality information (Lambert,Leuz, & Verrecchia, 2007).\n21.
